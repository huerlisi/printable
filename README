Printable
=========

Printable is a plugin simplifying printing using CUPS from Rails
applications.


Example
=======

In the controller there is a new method made available by this plugin:
print_action_for(method, options = {}).

Use it like this:

  class InvoicesController < ApplicationController
    print_action_for :shipping_document, :tray => :plain, :media => 'A5'
    print_action_for :invoice, :tray => :invoice
    print_action_for :reminder, :tray => :invoice

    def shipping_document
      [...]
    end

    def invoice
      [...]
    end

    def reminder
      [...]
    end
  end
